  - Sir, please tell us about Git and GitHub registration.

    - E.g., `"test data"` ‚Äî is the space indexed?  
  - Do we have arrays in Python?

  - How to stop execution in between lines? For example, in a 10-line code, how to stop after line 5?  
  - How to stop code stuck in a loop?  
  - What happens when the index value is `[-0]`? It shows `'m'`. Why?  
  - How is memory allocated for variables in Python?
